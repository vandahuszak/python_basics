  #1. do something to each item
  #2. for number in range(a, b):

#The code note from the game:

#number_of_hurdles = 6
#while number_of_hurdles > 0: 
    #jump()
    #number_of_hurdles -= 1 # In every iteration we decrementing number_of_hurdles by 1, to make the loop stop at some point.
    #print(number_of_hurdles)

#while at_goal() != True:
    #jump()

#while not at_goal():
    #jump()
